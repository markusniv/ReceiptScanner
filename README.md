# ReceiptScanner

This project was created for Metropolia UAS thesis researching the strengths of full stack development utilizing only TypeScript. It consists of a mobile application client and the backend. The project utilizes the tRPC library as the backbone of both the front and backend. Mobile application was created with React Native. PostgreSQL was used as the database, whilst Prisma was used for easier database integration.

Unlike the name suggests, the application does not allow for actual scanning of receipts and it was only the working title for the project. The app allows for regular users to sign in and enter 'receipt' data. Supervisor users can sign in and see the entered data and can either approve or disapprove these.

The application has no practical use and is here only as a portfolio entry.
